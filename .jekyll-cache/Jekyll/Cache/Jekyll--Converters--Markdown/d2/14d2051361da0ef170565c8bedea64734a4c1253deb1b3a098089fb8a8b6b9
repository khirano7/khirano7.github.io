<p>I just spent the past week relearning the basics of Javascript, here‚Äôs what I noticed:</p>

<h3 id="anything-not-used-regularly-was-forgotten">Anything Not Used Regularly Was Forgotten</h3>

<p>I originally learned Javascript for my job as a web developer, so I had a basic idea of what it looked like before my week of review. However, I did end up forgetting a lot of the features related to ES6 (ECMAScript 6). Some examples included the spread operator, destructuring, and promises. Since I wasn‚Äôt really using these features in my work, I forgot about their existence as time went on. So even though I did know the basics of Javascript entering this past week, it was really nice to get a review of things that may not be used as often.</p>

<p>Athletic Software Engineering is a method that involved high intensity and time constrained work. For my Software Engineering class, we participate in WODs (workout of the day). For each WOD, we are given a problem and a limited amount of time to write a solution. If you are able to complete the WOD in the allotted time period you were successful, otherwise you DNF - there is no in between. This approach forces me to quickly assess the problem, find the best possible solution, and write the code. There is no time for hesitation. Though this does sound like a very stressful way of learning, I think that it has been very beneficial to me so far. If I know how to approach the problem, my next challenge is how I can proficiently write the code. If I don‚Äôt know how to approach the problem, then I can learn from the DNF and hopefully finish a similar problem in the future.</p>

<p>As of right now, I have not had too much trouble with the WODs given to us so far. So who knows, this opinion may change in the future when I‚Äôm faced with harder problems. But for now, I believe that this view of ‚ÄúAthletic Software Engineering‚Äù can play a big role in learning and improving as a developer.</p>
